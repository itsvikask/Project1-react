#Installation
Please make sure you have setup NodeJs before proceeding with further steps.

Step 1 - Install Global Packages
You will need to install several packages for this setup. We will need some of the babel plugins so let's first install babel by running the following code in command prompt window.

Make sure to run the below 2 commands as administrator.

C:\Users\username>npm install -g babel

C:\Users\username>npm install -g babel-cli

Step 2 - Add Dependencies and plugins
We will use webpack bundler in these tutorials so let's install webpack and webpack-dev-server. Goto project root folder.

C:\Users\username\Desktop\reactApp>npm install webpack --save

C:\Users\username\Desktop\reactApp>npm install webpack-dev-server --save

Since we want to use React, we need to install it first. The --save command will add these packages to package.json file.

C:\Users\username\Desktop\reactApp>npm install react --save

C:\Users\username\Desktop\reactApp>npm install react-dom --save

Step 3 - We already mentioned that we will need some babel plugins so let's install it too.
